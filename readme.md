# Team 10 Integration Software repo
### This repo requires OpenMotor libraries to run
### Setup
- remote.py allows a user to control the robot's motion and claw manually, completing the remote control requirement
- marvelmind.py reads all i/o from the MarvelMind beacon, and calls openmotor libraries to drive between coordinates.
- Scout mode still in progress
